# MunicipalityProject-MoT-Trees

This is the Industrial Project, which is a project for adoptions of trees in Thessaloniki for the Municipality of Thessaloniki.

Our main focus as a group was to improve massively the application in terms of functionalities and change it from web focused application to mobile mainly.
Almost all of the implementations are done for the user due to the fact that it should be launched soon.

These are some photos of the UI, because the developers are not allowed to expose the repository (copyrighted).
